                                                             The multiple award winning LP-CRS is currently the only
                                                             system in the world that is able to extract valuable
                                                             hydrocarbon condensate from very low pressure gas including
                                                             flare gas in a compact and self-contained unit suitable for
                                                             both onshore and offshore facilities. The technology enhances
                                                             the recovery of stabilized crude by 10% to 30% and reduces
                                                             greenhouse gas (CO2) emission by approximately 10% to 30%.


                                                             ABOUT THE SYSTEM
                                                             Consisting of a series of heat exchangers, a cold separator and
                                                             a stabilizer column, the system uses the JT cooling coupled
                                                             with evaporative cooling effect that reduces the temperature
3D Model of Low Pressure Condensate Recovery System          of associated gas to strip the heavy ends of the gas stream.
                                                             The JT cooling effect is achieved either via a JT valve or a
                                                             Turbo Expander. The condensate stripped after cooling is
                                                             removed from the gas stream in the cold separator after
                                                             which it is stabilized in the column. All the water knocked-out
                                                             during cooling is reinjected into the cold gas stream prior to
                                                             heat exchange with the inlet associated gas stream. The
                                                             combination of JT cooling and the evaporation of water
                                                             enables very efficient cooling of the inlet associated gas
                                                             stream which is the key to the high performance of
                                                             condensate extraction.
