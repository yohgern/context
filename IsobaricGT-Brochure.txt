                                Isobaric Gas Transfer System (IsobaricGT™)
                                High Speed CNG Offloading Technology




 CONVENTIONAL CNG
 Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) is one of the most mature
 methods of transporting produced gas. The process and
 technology of conditioning produced gas as CNG is well
 known, simple and is one of the most inexpensive solutions.

 In an offshore environment however, many techno-
 commercial barriers exist. These include:

        Multiple CNG Carriers required to continuously
         receive and deliver gas to the delivery point.
        Energy      intensive,   requiring     compression,
         decompression, heating and recompression
        Relatively low production rates from each facility
         and potentially fluctuating rates


 These barriers makes the economic viability very challenging
 for most facilities and stranded gas fields with current
 conventional CNG systems.




 ISOBARIC GT™ SYSTEM
 A patent pending system developed by NGLTech that allows CNG transfer at very high rates and virtually no variation in pressure.




 MAIN FEATURES AND BENEFITS

     •   High rate loading and unloading to/from CNG
     •   No decompression and re-pressurization compressors required during transfer of CNG
     •   Eliminates expansion cooling and JT cooling effects
     •   Low energy consumption (in the kW range)
     •   Eliminates the need for re-compression and heating requirements.
     •   Allows almost complete emptying of the CNG cylinders at storage pressures.
